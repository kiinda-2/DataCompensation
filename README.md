For new data professionals, I would recommend:
1. Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python are tools to focus on learning
2. When negotiating for benefits health insuarance is key to consider
3. Consider working in an already established organization and roles that are hybrid or remote since they are both flexible and pay highly.
